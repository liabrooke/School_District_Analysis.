# School_District-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
### Purpose
###### Maria enlisted our help to find the connection between budgets allocated to each school and testing scores for each score. There has also been evidence of academic dishonesty regarding the ninth grade scores at Thomas High School. In order to keep the rest of the data intact, we modified our analysis to remove the altered scores.
